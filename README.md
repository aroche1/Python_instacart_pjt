#Project Overview

## **Business Case**

#### Instacart is an online grocery delivery and pick-up service company that even though has very good sales, its executives and managers want to abstract information from their customers' shopping behaviour to identify patterns, allowing customer base segmentation, and target each segment with a different marketing strategy.


## **Area of Opportunity**

#### The idea behind targetting each customer base segment with a different marketing strategy is to see if there's an effect on the sales of certain products linked to certain segment; **the right strategy will ensure Instacart targets the right customer profile with the appropiate products**.


## **Objectives, Scope & Deliverables**

#### Instacart's objective is to create a strategy for customer base segmentations based on their shopping behaviour.

#### To create and set the strategy, the following questions, arguments and claims were posed by the marketing and sales departments:
- What the busiest days and hours of the days in terms of placed orders?
  - To schedule times when there are fewer orders
- Is there any particular hour(s) when the people spend the most money?
  - What products to advertise during these times?
- Group prices by prices range, to help marketing and sales dtps. direct their strategy
- Which products are more popular than the others?
  - Which (product) departments have the highest frequency of product orders
- **Segment the different types of customers according to their ordering/shopping behaviour**:
  - What's the customers' distribution in regards to their brand loyalty (how often do they buy in Instacart)?
  - Are there any differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
  - Are there any differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
  - Is there any connection between age and family in terms of ordering habits?
  
The data used was an oper-source data set from instacart and complemented with CF's program.

The visualization made can be found in the "Visualizations" within "04 Analysis" folder.
